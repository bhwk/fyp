This is typical in patients with kidney failure who undergo dialysis, as one of its primary functions is to remove excess fluids and waste products that the kidneys are no longer effectively filtering out. The amount of fluid removed can depend on various factors including the patient's overall health condition, the duration between dialysis sessions, and how much fluid has accumulated since the last treatment. However, such a weight loss should be monitored by healthcare providers to ensure it is within safe limits and does not lead to complications like low blood pressure or other issues related to rapid fluid shifts."

This implies that while the patient's kidney function is impaired, dialysis provides some support in managing blood chemistry but does not fully restore normal kidney function."
