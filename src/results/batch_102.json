Older age is often associated with a higher risk of comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, which can affect both the need for and response to dialysis treatment. Additionally, older patients may have reduced physiological reserves, making them potentially less resilient to the physical stress that dialysis can impose on the body.
