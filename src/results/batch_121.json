Without the specific year for [DATE], an accurate age cannot be provided.\n\nRegarding the significance of monitoring creatinine levels post-kidney transplant: Regular tracking of these levels is vital because creatinine is a waste product that healthy kidneys filter out of the blood. Post-transplant, maintaining stable and normal creatinine levels (which are typically between 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL for adults) can indicate that the new kidney is functioning properly. Levels outside this range might suggest issues with the transplanted kidney's health or function, such as rejection or other complications. Therefore, monitoring these levels helps doctors promptly identify and address potential problems to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient."
