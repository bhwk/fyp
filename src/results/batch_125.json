This is often indicated by several key biomarkers:\n- Elevated levels of creatinine in the blood, typically ranging from 2.5 mg/dL to 3.4 mg/dL.\n- A low glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which measures how well the kidneys are filtering waste products from the blood; for dialysis, GFR is usually between 11 mL/min and 18 mL/min.\n- Proteinuria, or protein in the urine, with values typically ranging from 298 mg/dL to 363 mg/dL, indicating that the kidneys are not functioning properly as they are allowing proteins to leak into the urine. \n\nThese signs indicate significant renal dysfunction necessitating dialysis to help filter waste products and maintain fluid balance when the kidneys can no longer perform these functions adequately on their own."
