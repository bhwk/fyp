This suggests that the fluid removal during this particular dialysis session was consistent with previous treatments, indicating a stable response to dialysis therapy. However, it's important to consider other clinical parameters and the patient\u2019s overall condition for a comprehensive assessment of their health status. A significant weight loss through dialysis can also indicate effective removal of excess fluids from the body, which is often necessary in patients with kidney failure to manage fluid overload that can affect heart function and blood pressure among other issues."
