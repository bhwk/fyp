A normal GFR is typically above 90 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2, so the patient's current GFR value indicates severely reduced kidney function.\n\nThis decline is particularly concerning given their age because older adults are at an increased risk for various complications associated with CKD, including cardiovascular disease, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney dysfunction. Additionally, older individuals may have more difficulty managing the side effects of treatments and dealing with the overall health impacts of declining renal function.
