        "response": "Renal dialysis is often required when an individual's kidneys are no longer able to effectively filter waste products from the blood, which can occur due to chronic kidney disease or acute kidney failure. For someone with impaired kidney function as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels (2.5 mg/dL to 3.4 mg/dL) and a significantly reduced glomerular filtration rate (as low as 11 mL/min/1.73 sq M), dialysis serves the critical role of replacing some of the lost functions of the kidneys. This procedure can help manage fluid balance, remove waste products that would otherwise accumulate to harmful levels in the body, and maintain electrolyte stability.\n\nThe necessity for dialysis indicates a severe decline in kidney function where natural filtration rates are well below what is considered normal or healthy (typically around 90 mL/min/1.73 sq M). Undergoing renal dialysis can improve quality of life by alleviating symptoms such as fatigue, swelling from fluid retention, and nausea associated with the buildup of toxins in the blood. However, it also imposes a significant lifestyle adjustment due to the regular need for treatments, which can be time-consuming and physically demanding. Additionally, there are potential complications including infections at the dialysis access site or other systemic side effects related to the process itself."
