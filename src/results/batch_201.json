The ongoing need for oral health education suggests challenges in maintaining proper dental hygiene practices at home.\n\nOverall, these patterns highlight a history of both tooth and gum issues that require continuous management through regular cleanings, fillings, surgeries, and preventive measures like fluoride treatments."
