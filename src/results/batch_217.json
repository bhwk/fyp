However, her never-married status does not directly impact whether she is pregnant or not, as marital status is not a determinant factor for pregnancy. The medical records indicating multiple encounters from 2018 to 2024 suggest that there may have been several instances of pregnancy over this period, but without more specific details on the outcomes of these procedures (such as whether pregnancies were carried to term or ended in miscarriage, termination, etc.), it is not possible to conclusively determine her current pregnancy status. Further information would be needed to ascertain her present condition regarding pregnancy."
