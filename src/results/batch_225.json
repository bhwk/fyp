GBS can lead to serious infections in newborns if not addressed properly before delivery. The outcomes of these tests help healthcare providers understand whether the patient is carrying GBS, which would necessitate preventive measures during childbirth to protect the infant from potential infection. If both assays are positive for GBS antigen, it indicates that the patient carries the bacteria and appropriate interventions should be planned for the time of delivery to safeguard the newborn's health."
