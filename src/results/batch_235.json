Given the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and the subsequent birth date mentioned, it can be inferred that these procedures likely spanned across several months. Pre-eclampsia typically occurs after 20 weeks of gestation, suggesting that the patient was at least in the second trimester when diagnosed with this condition. Therefore, by the time the diagnosis was made and until the birth occurred, the patient would have been in the later stages of her pregnancy, most likely during the third trimester."
