For instance:\n- If [DATE] falls within 0-12 weeks before the childbirth entry date, she would have been in her first trimester.\n- If [DATE] is between 13-26 weeks before childbirth, then she was likely in her second trimester.\n- And if [DATE] is closer than 27 weeks to the childbirth date but not within the last few days, she was probably in her third trimester.\n\nFor a more precise answer, please provide the exact dates."

Anxiety assessment revealed a GAD-7 total score of approximately 3 which also suggests low levels of anxiety.\n\nOverall, these evaluations suggest some concerns around emotional well-being and relationships, but the patient does not appear to be experiencing severe mental health issues based on their scoring.",
