However, based on the provided information stating she was 3 years and 11 months old during the medical assessment, there seems to be a discrepancy without specifying the exact birth date in 2013. Assuming the given information is correct regarding her age at the time of the assessment (3 years and 11 months), then that would be the accurate representation based on the provided details."

However, from the given encounters, we can observe fluctuations in both height and weight measurements that do not follow a clear trend without knowing when these measurements were taken or the intervals between each encounter.\n\nThe Body Weight and Height data show variations:\n\n- The tallest measurement (113 cm) is noted at Encounter 5.\n- The heaviest weight (21 kg) corresponds with the tallest height measurement, indicating potential healthy growth at that point.\n- There are lower values for both height and weight in other encounters (e.g., 75 cm and 10.6 kg at Encounter 6), which could suggest a period of slower growth or even regression if these measurements were taken chronologically.\n\nWithout age-specific percentile data, it is difficult to definitively state whether the patient's growth status is within normal ranges for their age and sex. To accurately assess the patient\u2019s growth status compared to her age and sex percentile, a pediatrician would typically use standardized growth charts that take into account these factors along with the measurements provided over time.\n\nFor an accurate assessment, one should consult with a healthcare provider who can place these measurements in context using appropriate growth standards or charts."
