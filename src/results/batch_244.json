        "response": "Based on the blood pressure reading provided (Systolic: approximately 113 mm[Hg] and Diastolic: about 87 mm[Hg]), we can categorize this as elevated or prehypertension according to the guidelines used in many clinical settings. Typically:\n\n- Normal Blood Pressure is defined as a Systolic pressure below 120 mm[Hg] and a Diastolic pressure below 80 mm[Hg].\n- Elevated Blood Pressure (or Prehypertension) is characterized by a Systolic pressure ranging from 120 to 129 mm[Hg], with the condition that the Diastolic pressure remains less than 80 mm[Hg]. However, given that the diastolic reading here is above this threshold at about 87 mm[Hg], it doesn't fit neatly into the prehypertension category as traditionally defined.\n- Hypertension Stage 1 would typically be diagnosed if a Systolic pressure ranges from 130 to 139 mm[Hg] or a Diastolic pressure is between 80 and 89 mm[Hg].\n\nGiven that the diastolic reading of about 87 mm[Hg] exceeds what's considered normal (below 80 mm[Hg]) but doesn't meet the criteria for Stage 1 hypertension, this patient might be at a borderline or elevated risk category. However, because the systolic value is under 130 and the diastolic is above 80, it indicates an increased risk of developing hypertension, and closer monitoring or lifestyle changes may be recommended to prevent progression to hypertension.\n\nIt's important to note that blood pressure can fluctuate throughout the day and over time due to various factors. Therefore, multiple readings are usually taken before making a definitive diagnosis or categorization."
