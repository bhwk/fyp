However, the report mentions that the patient experienced moderate pain during or after the procedure, rated at about 4 out of 10. While the dialysis appears to have been completed and did result in some fluid removal, the presence of moderate pain does not definitively indicate whether the procedure was fully successful from a comfort standpoint. More specific details on clinical outcomes or effectiveness would be needed for a comprehensive assessment of success."
