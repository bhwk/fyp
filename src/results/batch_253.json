They can involve questions about the use of substances like alcohol, prescription medications, illicit drugs, and more, assessing the frequency, quantity, and impact on daily life.\n\nEach procedure serves a specific purpose in evaluating different aspects of health and well-being, from mental health conditions to physical disorders that affect sleep quality, and issues related to substance misuse."
