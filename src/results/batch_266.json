However, based on the procedures performed during dental encounters, it can be inferred that Patient A required routine and specialized care. This included multiple instances of plaque and calculus removal from all teeth, suggesting a need for consistent professional cleaning likely due to poor at-home oral hygiene or other factors contributing to plaque accumulation. Additionally, there were surgical procedures such as gingivectomy or gingivoplasty indicating possible gum disease conditions like gingivitis or periodontal issues.
