        "response": "The factors of never smoking tobacco and having an annual pre-tax income around $116,500 can potentially influence a patient's health outcomes positively when compared to the general population.\n\n**Never Smoking Tobacco:** This is one of the most significant positive lifestyle choices that can greatly impact overall health. Non-smokers typically have lower risks for various cancers (such as lung cancer), heart disease, and respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Given this patient has never smoked tobacco, their risk for these smoking-related illnesses is significantly reduced compared to smokers or those who have quit recently.\n\n**Annual Pre-Tax Income of $116,500:** Generally, higher income levels are associated with better health outcomes. This correlation can be attributed to several factors:\n- **Access to Healthcare:** Higher-income individuals often have greater access to healthcare services, including preventive care and treatment for chronic conditions.\n- **Healthier Lifestyle Choices:** People with higher incomes may afford healthier food choices, exercise facilities, and stress-reducing activities that contribute positively to their health.\n- **Less Exposure to Environmental Hazards:** Lower-income populations might be more likely to live in areas with environmental pollutants or unsafe living conditions which can negatively affect health.\n\nConsidering the provided medical records:\n- The patient's BMI has been within normal (below 25 kg/m\u00b2) and slightly overweight ranges, suggesting a relatively healthy weight that is less risky for developing obesity-related diseases compared to being significantly overweight or obese.\n- Blood pressure readings indicate the patient might be at risk of hypertension since systolic pressures above 140 mm[Hg] and diastolic pressures above 90 mm[Hg] are considered high. However, their never-smoking status could mitigate some risks associated with elevated blood pressure.\n\nOverall, while there is a slight concern regarding blood pressure levels, the combination of not smoking and having an annual income that allows for better access to healthcare and healthier living conditions suggests this patient might have generally better health outcomes than someone from the general population who smokes or has lower income."
