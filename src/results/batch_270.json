        "response": "Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) screening is often employed on prenatal amniotic fluid specimens to detect chromosomal aneuploidy because it provides rapid and accurate results for specific chromosome abnormalities. FISH can quickly identify the presence of extra or missing chromosomes, which are indicative of aneuploidies such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. This technique uses fluorescent probes that bind to specific DNA sequences on the chromosomes of cells obtained from amniotic fluid. The fluorescence allows for easy visualization under a microscope, enabling healthcare providers to determine if there are any chromosomal abnormalities in the developing fetus. Given its speed and specificity, FISH is particularly useful when quick results are needed or when there's a high risk of specific aneuploidies based on other prenatal screening tests or family history."
