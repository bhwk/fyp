However, at her highest recorded BMI value of 27.7 kg/m\u00b2, she enters into the 'overweight' category.\n\nWithout specific comparative data for females in her age group, a precise comparison cannot be made. Generally, though, if we consider that a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal for most adults, the patient's range suggests she has been mostly within or slightly above this 'normal' weight category at different points in time."
