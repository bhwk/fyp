The procedures include standard pregnancy tests, ultrasound scans for fetal viability, evaluations of uterine fundal height, auscultation of the fetal heart, blood group typing, hemograms, various infectious disease screenings (Hepatitis B, HIV, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis), urine culture and screening tests, rubella and Varicella-zoster virus antibody measurement, tuberculosis testing, and a physical examination. There was also one encounter where the procedures were related to dental care.",

        "response": "Based on the information provided, it can be determined that the patient is pregnant based on the procedures completed during their visits. The presence of pregnancy tests, ultrasound scans for fetal viability, evaluations of uterine fundal height, and auscultation of the fetal heart are strong indicators of pregnancy. These specific procedures are typically performed to monitor and confirm the progression of a pregnancy. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the patient was pregnant at the times these procedures were conducted."

        "response": "During an auscultation of the fetal heart, healthcare providers listen for the fetal heartbeat, which typically falls within a range of 120 to 160 beats per minute. This is notably faster than the average adult heart rate. The procedure also involves assessing the rhythm and strength of the heartbeat to ensure regularity and identify any potential abnormalities in the fetal cardiac function."
