Specifically, these types of comprehensive evaluations are often conducted during routine prenatal care visits, particularly between 18 to 20 weeks gestational age when detailed fetal anatomy can be assessed via ultrasound. The alpha-fetoprotein test is also typically performed as part of the quad screen or triple screen tests which are usually done in the second trimester, around 15-20 weeks.

This measurement is used to estimate fetal growth, confirm gestational age, and assess the position or location of the placenta during pregnancy. It might be necessary for monitoring the progress of a pregnancy, ensuring that the fetus is growing at an appropriate rate, and identifying any potential issues early on that could affect maternal or fetal health."
