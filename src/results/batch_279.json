        "response": "Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique used to detect and localize the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences on chromosomes. During prenatal examinations, FISH can be utilized to identify chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidies, which involve gains or losses of whole chromosomes or chromosome segments. This method allows for rapid analysis of specific regions of interest, providing crucial information about potential genetic disorders that could affect the fetus. For example, it is commonly used to detect trisomies like Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). The purpose of using FISH during prenatal examinations is to offer early diagnosis and allow for informed decision-making regarding the pregnancy, as well as preparation for potential medical interventions or support post-birth."
