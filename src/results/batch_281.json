On the other hand, depression screenings are important for early detection of depressive symptoms which could affect a patient\u2019s quality of life and overall health outcomes. They might be conducted if there is a suspicion of mood changes, as part of a routine mental health check-up, or due to known risk factors.\n\nWithout additional clinical notes or detailed patient history, it's not possible to determine the specific medical justifications for these screenings on [DATE], [DATE], and [DATE].
