This suggests that there is no marked elevation in AST levels, which would be indicative of liver or other tissue damage.\n\nOverall, these results suggest that the patient\u2019s liver function does not show signs of significant impairment as measured by ALT and AST. However, it should be noted that while both enzymes are within normal limits, the upper end of the AST range (37.80 U/L) is approaching what might be considered slightly elevated for some laboratories or clinical contexts. This could warrant further monitoring if there are other risk factors present or if there's a trend towards increasing levels over time.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider that liver function assessment should ideally involve a comprehensive panel of tests and take into account the patient\u2019s overall medical history, symptoms, and lifestyle factors."
