The auscultation allows healthcare providers to listen for the heartbeat of the fetus, which confirms that the fetus is alive and provides an indication of its health. Any changes in the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat can alert the provider to potential issues.\n\nThe evaluation of uterine fundal height, on the other hand, helps to estimate the size of the uterus and track fetal growth over time. This measurement should correspond with gestational age, and deviations from expected measurements may indicate problems such as intrauterine growth restriction or an inaccurate estimation of due date.\n\nBy performing these assessments during multiple encounters throughout different stages of pregnancy, healthcare providers can monitor the progress and health of both mother and fetus effectively, ensuring timely interventions if any issues arise."
