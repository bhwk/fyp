Here\u2019s an overview of the procedure:\n\n1. **Supragingival Plaque and Calculus Removal**: The dentist or hygienist begins by removing visible above-gumline (supragingival) plaque and tartar using specialized tools such as scalers, curettes, or ultrasonic devices. These tools are designed to effectively scrape away the hard deposits of calculus that have formed on the tooth surfaces above the gum line.\n\n2. **Subgingival Plaque and Calculus Removal**: Following this, attention is given to below-gumline (subgingival) areas where plaque and tartar can also accumulate. This part of the procedure requires careful handling as it involves reaching beneath the gum line. The dentist or hygienist uses specialized instruments such as curettes with specific angles that allow them to access these deeper regions effectively.\n\n3. **Multiple Visits**: Given the extent of work required, especially in areas where calculus is more firmly attached or where significant subgingival deposits exist, the process is typically divided into several visits ([DATE], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE], and [DATE]). This approach allows for a thorough cleaning while also ensuring that the patient's comfort and gum health are maintained throughout the treatment.\n\n4. **Post-Cleaning Care**: After each session of plaque and calculus removal, the dentist may recommend or provide further instructions on maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent future buildup of plaque and calculus.\n\nThis comprehensive cleaning process is crucial for preventing periodontal disease and maintaining overall dental health by removing the harmful bacteria that can lead to inflammation and infection."
