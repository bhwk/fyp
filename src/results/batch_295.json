The diastolic readings range between 65 and 79 mm[Hg], which is within the normal range.\n\nGiven that part of the systolic blood pressure readings fall into the \"Elevated\" category, it suggests an increased risk for developing hypertension. However, since none of the recorded values exceed the threshold for Stage 1 Hypertension (systolic \u2265 130 mm[Hg] or diastolic \u2265 80 mm[Hg]), we cannot definitively say the patient has hypertension based on this information alone.\n\nIn summary, while there is a risk due to some elevated systolic readings, more monitoring and potentially lifestyle modifications may be recommended to prevent progression toward hypertension."

These procedures are standard during prenatal care visits to assess both maternal and fetal well-being.\n\nThe evaluation of uterine fundal height involves measuring from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus (fundus) to ensure that the fetus is growing at an appropriate rate for its gestational age. This measurement can help indicate if the pregnancy is progressing normally or if there are any concerns about growth, such as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nAuscultation of the fetal heart involves listening to the heartbeat of the fetus using a fetoscope or Doppler device. It helps confirm that the fetus has a strong and regular heartbeat, which is an essential indicator of fetal health.\n\nTogether, these procedures provide valuable information about the pregnancy status but do not specify the exact stage of pregnancy without additional context such as gestational age or ultrasound findings."
