Medical professionals also performed auscultation to listen for the fetal heart sounds. Blood tests were extensive and included blood group typing, a comprehensive hemogram with red and white blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, indices, platelet count, and manual white blood cell differential. Additionally, there was testing for various infectious diseases such as Hepatitis B (surface antigen measurement), HIV (antigen test), Chlamydia (antigen test), Gonorrhea (infection titer test), Syphilis (infectious titer test), and a confirmatory test for Hepatitis C antibodies. A cytopathology procedure was performed, involving the preparation of a smear from a genital source, and urine tests included culture and screening for diabetes. Other screenings covered Rubella and Varicella-zoster virus antibody levels, with a skin test (Tine test) for tuberculosis also conducted. Urine protein testing was part of the assessment as well. Lastly, a thorough physical examination was performed to complete the comprehensive health evaluation during the encounter."

        "synthesized information": "Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique used to detect chromosomal aneuploidy in prenatal diagnostics. It involves probing amniotic fluid cells with fluorescently labeled DNA probes that bind to specific sequences on chromosomes. This allows for the visualization and quantification of chromosome copy numbers under a fluorescence microscope, which can help identify conditions such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). The technique is highly sensitive and specific, providing rapid results that contribute significantly to prenatal diagnosis by confirming or ruling out chromosomal abnormalities.",
