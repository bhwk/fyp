Generally, a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m\u00b2 is considered overweight. This suggests that the individual may have an increased risk for health issues related to excess weight, but it's important to consider other factors such as muscle mass, overall health, and lifestyle when assessing the patient\u2019s health status comprehensively."
