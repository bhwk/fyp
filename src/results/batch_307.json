By measuring how high the top of the uterus (the fundus) has risen in the abdomen, doctors can estimate fetal size and confirm that the pregnancy is progressing as expected. Typically, the uterus expands at specific rates throughout gestation, and any deviations from these norms might indicate potential issues such as intrauterine growth restriction or polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid). Regular assessments of uterine fundal height enable early identification of any concerns, ensuring timely intervention if necessary to support the health of both mother and baby."

However, generally speaking, an Alpha-fetoprotein test in a pregnancy typically helps assess the risk of certain fetal abnormalities such as neural tube defects (like spina bifida and anencephaly) and abdominal wall defects. It can also be used to evaluate the risk of Down syndrome in some contexts. The AFP levels measured in maternal blood can indicate potential issues that may require further diagnostic testing, like amniocentesis or detailed ultrasound examinations."
