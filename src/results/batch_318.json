These conditions suggest ongoing need for pain management.\n  \n- **Pain Scores**:\n    - On 04-01-2015, the reported pain severity was 8 out of 10.\n    - On 02-09-2015, it was 7 out of 10.\n    - On 24-07-2016, it decreased to 6 out of 10.\n    - On 01-04-2018 and 01-05-2019, the pain severity was reported at 5 out of 10 each time. \n    - By 04-04-2019, her self-reported pain severity had further decreased to 4 out of 10.\n\n- **Medications**: Her medication history includes multiple instances where she has been prescribed acetaminophen combined with oxycodone or hydrocodone bitartrate. This combination is often used for managing moderate to severe pain. Additionally, she was on Trinessa and Levora, which are contraceptive pills but not directly related to pain management.\n\n- **Procedures**: She had extractions of wisdom teeth completed in both 2015 and 2019. These procedures were likely aimed at alleviating or managing dental-related pain.\n\nOverall, Carlyn477 Williamson769's medical records indicate a history of chronic pain conditions managed with various medications and specific dental procedures. The trend in her self-reported pain scores shows some improvement over time, from severe to moderate levels."
