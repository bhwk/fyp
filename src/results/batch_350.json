        "response": "Given the medical procedure of ligation of bilateral fallopian tubes that the patient has undergone, there would be significant implications for her future fertility. Bilateral tubal ligation is a surgical procedure that involves blocking both fallopian tubes to prevent eggs from reaching the uterus and sperm from reaching the egg, thereby preventing fertilization and pregnancy. This procedure is generally considered permanent contraception.\n\nWhile there are techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) which can bypass the need for intact fallopian tubes, natural conception would not be possible due to the obstruction created by the ligation. Therefore, if future fertility is a concern, alternative assisted reproductive technologies might be considered, but natural pregnancy would not be feasible without surgical intervention to reverse the tubal ligation, which has its own success rates and considerations.\n\nThe patient's marital status (divorced) does not directly affect her biological ability to conceive post-tubal ligation. However, it may influence personal decisions regarding family planning and potential emotional or psychological impacts related to fertility desires in the context of her current life circumstances."
