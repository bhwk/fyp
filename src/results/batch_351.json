This aligns with the findings from the Weight-for-Length Percentile and suggests no significant issues regarding obesity or underweight.\n\n- **Blood Pressure**: The blood pressure readings (92 mm[Hg] diastolic and 112 mm[Hg] systolic) may be on the higher end, but without additional context (such as age-specific norms), it is not conclusive whether this represents a concern. However, elevated blood pressure could indicate potential hypertension or other cardiovascular risks that might need monitoring.\n\n- **Cardiorespiratory Health**: The heart rate at about 88 beats per minute and respiratory rate at around 14 breaths per minute are within normal ranges for an individual of their age, indicating no immediate issues with cardiorespiratory health.\n\n- **Tobacco Use**: The patient has never smoked tobacco, which is a positive indicator in terms of lifestyle choices that could affect long-term health outcomes.\n\nOverall, the provided information suggests that this patient is generally healthy with normal growth and development indicators. However, attention should be given to their blood pressure readings as they may indicate potential risks that require further evaluation or monitoring over time."

The diastolic (lower number) blood pressures ranged from 87 mm[Hg] to 95 mm[Hg], and systolic (upper number) blood pressures varied between 109 mm[Hg] and 116 mm[Hg]. \n\nFor an adult, a normal blood pressure is generally considered less than 120/80 mm[Hg]. A reading of 120-129/<80 mm[Hg] is elevated. However, the patient's systolic readings are notably low for what would be expected in an \"elevated\" category and fall into a range that can sometimes indicate hypotension (low blood pressure), especially given the relatively high diastolic numbers.\n\nThe notable reading of 112/92 mm[Hg] is particularly concerning as it shows a higher than normal diastolic measurement, which could be indicative of isolated diastolic hypertension. However, the systolic readings are quite low, which might suggest an issue with hypotension or another underlying condition that affects blood pressure regulation.\n\nGiven these details, without additional context about the patient's age and overall health status, it seems that while the systolic values may not be abnormally high, the diastolic values are consistently on the higher side of normal. It would be advisable to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate assessment considering all aspects of the patient\u2019s medical history and current condition."
