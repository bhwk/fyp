        "response": "The removal of both supragingival (above the gum line) and subgingival (below the gum line) plaque and calculus was necessary for maintaining good oral health in this case because the patient had a significant buildup of these substances. Regular professional cleaning was needed to address this issue, as indicated by the repeated occurrences of such procedures in their dental records. This suggests that the patient might have had difficulties with self-care or possibly other factors contributing to plaque and calculus accumulation, necessitating frequent intervention to prevent oral health complications like gum disease."
