Given that smoking tobacco can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, which often result in an increased respiratory rate and irregular or elevated heart rates due to the body's struggle to get enough oxygen and manage stress on the heart, the absence of these factors likely contributes to the patient maintaining a normal range for both their respiratory rates (13-16 breaths per minute) and heart rates (72-97 beats per minute).

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, normal diastolic blood pressure values vary by age, sex, and height percentile; however, as a general guideline, a reading in the 90-93 mm[Hg] range would often be considered elevated or even hypertensive for many children.\n\nFor example:\n- For children aged between 1 to 5 years old, diastolic blood pressures usually fall below 74 mm[Hg].\n- For those aged between 6 and 12 years old, normal diastolic BP is typically below 78 mm[Hg] (depending on the height percentile).\n\nGiven these general standards, a diastolic pressure of 91.00 mm[Hg] would likely be considered elevated or high for most pediatric patients, potentially indicating hypertension if it persists across multiple visits.\n\nIt's important to note that blood pressure readings should always be interpreted in context with other clinical findings and the child\u2019s overall health status. Persistent higher-than-normal blood pressure could suggest an underlying issue such as primary hypertension, which can occur due to genetic factors or secondary conditions like kidney disease. Further diagnostic evaluation might be warranted if these readings continue to indicate elevated blood pressure levels."
