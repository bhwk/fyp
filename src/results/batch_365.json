Pain severity was rated at 4.30 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale.\n\n- **26-03-2024**: The patient's pain severity reduced to 2.70 on the reported scale following Movement therapy (regime/therapy).\n\n- **03-05-2024**: Pain severity escalated again, with a reported score of 7.55, but Movement therapy was continued.\n\nThe pain management approach for Aleisha941 Treutel973 involves:\n\n- Assessment using the PEG scale and numeric rating scales to monitor the intensity and impact of pain on daily activities.\n- Application of **Movement therapy** as a non-pharmacological intervention to manage pain, which showed initial effectiveness (reduction from 4.30 to 2.70) but with subsequent relapse in severity.\n\nThe ongoing use of Movement therapy suggests that this is the primary approach being used for Aleisha941 Treutel973's pain management at present."

        "response": "To calculate how old the patient was during their encounter, we need to know both the year they were born ([YEAR]) and the exact date of the encounter ([DATE]). Since the formula to calculate age involves subtracting the birth year from the encounter year and adjusting for whether the encounter date has passed the birthdate in that year, here's how you would do it:\n\n1. Determine the difference between [DATE]'s year and [YEAR].\n2. If [DATE] is before the patient\u2019s birthday within that year, subtract one more year from the difference found in step 1 to account for the fact that their birthday has not yet occurred.\n\nHowever, without specific values for [DATE] and [YEAR], I cannot provide a numerical answer. Please replace [DATE] with the actual date of the encounter and [YEAR] with the birth year to compute the patient's age at the time of the encounter."
