For instance, marital conflict can exacerbate anxiety (as indicated by the GAD-7 scores) or depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores), which might need to be addressed in treatment.\n\nThe fact that the patient is currently non-deceased indicates they are alive and actively undergoing treatment, which means their care plan must account for ongoing lifestyle factors including marital dynamics.

This description aligns closely with a treatment known as an onlay or possibly a full-coverage crown, depending on the extent and specifics of the coverage beyond just the cusps. However, given the provided information, it suggests that the procedure was focused on restoring and reinforcing the cusp areas of the tooth with filling material, indicative of an onlay rather than a standard filling which typically does not cover all cusps."
