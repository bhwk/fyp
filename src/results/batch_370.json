For the Patient Health Questionnaire-9: Modified for Teens, the score ranges from 1 to 3.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that typically, both the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales can range from 0 to 21. Each of the seven items in the GAD-7 and each of the nine items in the PHQ-9 is scored on a four-point scale (0 = not at all; 3 = nearly every day), allowing for a total score that ranges across these values. The specific ranges mentioned here seem to reflect only this patient's scores rather than the full possible range of the scales."

This letter typically includes detailed information about the patient's case, the reasons for the referral, and any preliminary findings from initial examinations or tests conducted by the primary care provider.\n\nThis process ensures continuity of care and provides the specialist with necessary background information to effectively continue treatment."
