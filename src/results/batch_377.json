Additionally, preventive measures such as calcium and vitamin D supplementation are important.\n- **Chronic Pain**: Management could involve pain relief medications or more invasive procedures like nerve blocks if conservative treatments fail.\n- **Recurrent Gingivitis & Dental Caries**: These might require frequent dental cleanings, fillings, and possibly extractions.\n\nEach of these conditions reflects the typical health challenges faced by individuals at this advanced age, requiring a comprehensive healthcare approach to manage symptoms and maintain quality of life."
