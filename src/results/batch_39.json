Typically:\n\n- Underweight is defined as a BMI below 18.5 kg/m\u00b2,\n- Normal weight is between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m\u00b2,\n- Overweight is from 25 to 29.9 kg/m\u00b2, and\n- Obesity begins at 30 kg/m\u00b2 or higher.\n\nPotential health implications of being in the overweight category include an increased risk for various conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), certain types of cancer, and metabolic syndrome. It is recommended that individuals with a BMI within this range consider lifestyle changes to maintain or improve their overall health, including dietary modifications and regular physical activity."
