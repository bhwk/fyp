        "response": "Yes, the multiple removals of supragingival and subgingival plaque and calculus from all teeth over several encounters can indicate an underlying periodontal disease. This is because the repeated necessity for these procedures suggests ongoing issues with dental hygiene that could be linked to conditions such as gingivitis or more advanced forms of periodontal disease, where the accumulation of plaque and calculus persists despite interventions. Effective management of periodontal health typically requires consistent professional cleaning along with good at-home oral care practices; however, persistent need for these cleanings over a prolonged time (from 2016 to the present) points towards an ongoing problem that may warrant further investigation into the specific causes and treatment options for any underlying periodontal disease."
