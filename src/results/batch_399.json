Most recently, the BMI has been approximately 15.1 kg/m\u00b2, which corresponds to a percentile range of about 13% to 14%. This indicates that the patient's weight is on the lower side compared to others of similar age and sex.\n\nOn another occasion, when the BMI was around 17.2 kg/m\u00b2, it placed the individual at approximately the 30th percentile. Overall, these BMIs suggest that the patient tends to be in a relatively lean category compared to their peers of the same age and sex, with more recent measurements indicating particularly low BMI values."
