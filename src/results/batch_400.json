Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) could be an attractive option given its potential to modify the course of allergic disease and reduce symptoms over time.\n\nHowever, several factors might influence this patient's decision-making regarding SCIT:\n\n1. **Severity and Frequency of Symptoms:** Since the patient has a history of severe allergic reactions necessitating the use of an epinephrine auto-injector, they may be more inclined towards seeking definitive treatment options like SCIT that can potentially reduce their dependency on emergency medications.\n\n2. **Financial Considerations:** The cost of long-term therapy and whether it is covered by insurance could be a significant factor. Given no mention of marital status affecting financial resources directly, the patient's decision might depend on personal financial capability or insurance coverage specifics.\n\n3. **Social Support:** Despite being unmarried, if they have strong social support from friends, family, or community members, this could positively influence their willingness to undergo a treatment that requires regular visits and ongoing commitment.\n\n4. **Personal Beliefs and Preferences:** The patient\u2019s beliefs about medical interventions might also play a role. Given the presence of depression screening and anxiety assessment in their history, they may be more cautious or skeptical towards any form of long-term therapy. However, if informed properly about the benefits and risks, their personal preference for managing allergies effectively could lead them to choose SCIT.\n\n5. **Time Commitment:** SCIT requires a substantial time commitment with regular injections over several years. The patient\u2019s willingness to adhere to this regimen will be crucial in deciding whether to proceed with SCIT.\n\nIn summary, while the unmarried status might not directly impact their decision-making regarding SCIT, it is their comprehensive health history and personal circumstances that would likely guide their choice towards considering SCIT as a viable option for managing their allergies."
