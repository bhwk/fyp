        "response": "The information provided gives an overview of when the subcutaneous immunotherapy procedures took place but does not specify the details of each procedure. Subcutaneous immunotherapy typically involves injecting a small amount of allergen under the skin to help build up tolerance over time, reducing allergic reactions in the future.\n\nBased on the dates given (early December 2023, around mid-January 2024, near the beginning of April 2024, approximately late June 2024, and more recently in October 2024), it can be inferred that this patient received regular injections as part of a regimen designed to manage allergies through gradual exposure. Each procedure likely followed a standardized protocol involving a trained healthcare provider administering the allergen solution at an appropriate dose based on the patient's progress and response to previous treatments.\n\nFor more specific details about each session, such as the exact dosage administered or any immediate reactions observed post-injection, additional medical records would be required."
