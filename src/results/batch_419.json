However, without a specific date provided for [DATE] in the query or information section, I cannot provide a precise age.\n\nIf you can specify an exact encounter date, I can then perform this calculation for you. For example:\n- If the encounter date were July 2, 2023, the patient would be exactly 17 years old.\n- If it was any day after July 2, 2023, up to and including July 1, 2024, they would still be considered 17 until their next birthday."
