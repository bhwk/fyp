First, calculate the difference between the years: 2023 - 1975 = 48.\n2. Check if the dialysis session date (March 20) has passed in the year of birth or not. Since March is after January, and assuming we're calculating for a person born on any day before or on March 20, this means that by March 20, 2023, the patient would indeed be 48 years old.\n\nTherefore, with these example dates, the patient would have been 48 years old during his dialysis session.
