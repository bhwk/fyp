For example, conditions that affect bone density can influence the success and approach taken for dental surgeries. If a patient has lower bone density, which is common in osteoporosis or other similar conditions, it could mean that the jawbone may not provide as stable a foundation for surgical procedures such as gingivectomy (surgical removal of gum tissue) or even routine fillings. This might require more careful handling and potentially different techniques to ensure the stability and longevity of dental work. Additionally, fluoride treatments can help strengthen tooth enamel but have no direct effect on bone density itself; however, maintaining overall oral health is important for patients with compromised bone density as it helps prevent further complications that could arise from poor dental hygiene or untreated conditions like periodontal disease, which can lead to bone loss in the jaw."
