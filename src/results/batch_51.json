Monitoring the weight difference before and after dialysis provides critical information on how effectively the treatment is managing fluid balance. Significant fluctuations or inadequate removal of fluids can lead to complications such as hypertension, heart failure, or pulmonary edema.\n\n2. **Pain Severity**: Pain severity scores give healthcare providers insight into the patient's comfort level and any potential issues arising from the dialysis process itself, such as catheter discomfort, muscle cramps due to fluid shifts, or vascular access site pain. Monitoring this can help in adjusting the treatment parameters for better patient tolerance and comfort.\n\nTogether, these observations allow medical professionals to assess both the physiological impact of dialysis (fluid balance) and the patient\u2019s subjective experience (pain), ensuring comprehensive care and timely adjustments to improve outcomes and quality of life."
