Calculate the difference in years between the dental consultation date (for example, [DATE_3]) and the birthdate.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step calculation using placeholders:\n- Assume [BIRTH_YEAR] = 1985, so the assumed date of birth is January 1, 1985.\n- If [DATE_3] represents the dental consultation on March 10, 2023:\n\nAge at consultation would be calculated as follows:\n```\nMarch 10, 2023 - January 1, 1985 = 38 years and about 3 months\n```\n\nTherefore, she was approximately 38 years old during her dental consultation.\n\nTo give you an exact age, please replace the placeholders with actual values."
