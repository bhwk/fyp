This removal contributes to oral health by preventing conditions such as gum disease, tooth decay, and bad breath.",
        "review": "",
        "response": "The removal of both supragingival (above the gum line) and subgingival (below the gum line) plaque and calculus is essential for maintaining good oral health. According to observations made after performing these dental procedures on patients, such removal significantly contributes to preventing conditions like gum disease, tooth decay, and bad breath. This is because plaque and calculus harbor bacteria that can cause inflammation of the gums (gingivitis), which may progress to more severe forms of periodontal disease if left untreated. Additionally, the bacteria in these deposits can contribute to the breakdown of enamel, leading to cavities or tooth decay. By eliminating these harmful accumulations, dental health professionals help ensure a cleaner and healthier oral environment for their patients."
