Specifically:\n\n- The Total Cholesterol level of around 203 mg/dL falls into the borderline high category (normal is below 200 mg/dL).\n- Triglycerides at approximately 140 mg/dL are also considered borderline high (normal is below 150 mg/dL).\n- LDL-Cholesterol, often referred to as \"bad cholesterol,\" at about 118 mg/dL falls into the near optimal/above optimal range (optimal is less than 100 mg/dL for individuals with heart disease or diabetes; 100-129 mg/dL is considered near optimal).\n- HDL-Cholesterol, known as \"good cholesterol,\" at roughly 60 mg/dL is in the desirable category (desirable level is above 40 mg/dL for men and above 50 mg/dL for women).\n\nGiven these levels, particularly the borderline high Total Cholesterol and Triglycerides along with the near optimal LDL-Cholesterol, combined with a favorable HDL-Cholesterol level, the overall assessment leans towards moderate cardiovascular risk. However, other factors such as age, family history, smoking status, blood pressure, and diabetes also significantly influence the comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular health risk."
