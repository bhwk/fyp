Specifically:\n\n- A systolic blood pressure between 90 and 120 mm[Hg] is considered within the normal range.\n- Diastolic blood pressure between 60 and 80 mm[Hg] also falls into the normal category.\n\nHowever, when diastolic readings are consistently at or above 80 mm[Hg], it can indicate prehypertension, especially if systolic values remain below 130 mm[Hg]. This means that while the patient's blood pressure is not currently classified as hypertension (high blood pressure), there may be a risk of developing high blood pressure in the future.
