Additionally, the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) values range from a low of 6 mL/min/1.73 sq M to a high of around 80 mL/min/1.73 sq M, which indicates compromised kidney performance. A GFR below normal ranges (which is typically considered to be between 90-120 mL/min/1.73 sq M for healthy adults) suggests that the kidneys are not filtering blood as efficiently as they should."
