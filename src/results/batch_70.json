The GAD-7 is a screening tool used to assess the severity of generalized anxiety disorder, and typically, a score between 5 and 9 suggests mild anxiety.\n  \n- A PHQ-2 (Patient Health Questionnaire-2) total score of 1 suggests minimal depressive symptoms. The PHQ-2 is often used as an initial screen for depression; scores can range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of significant depressive symptoms.\n\n- An AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption) total score of 1 indicates low-risk alcohol consumption. This test assesses patterns and quantity of drinking to identify harmful or potentially hazardous levels of alcohol use; lower scores generally suggest safer levels of alcohol use that are less likely to cause health problems.\n\nOverall, these scores indicate that the patient is experiencing mild anxiety, has minimal depressive symptoms, and engages in low-risk alcohol consumption."
