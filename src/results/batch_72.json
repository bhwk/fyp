        "response": "The potential reason for a patient's weight difference of approximately 1.8 kg before and after undergoing renal dialysis on [DATE] could be attributed to the fluid removal that occurs during the dialysis process. Dialysis helps filter waste products from the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly, and part of this process involves removing excess fluids from the body to manage swelling and hypertension, thus leading to a reduction in weight."
