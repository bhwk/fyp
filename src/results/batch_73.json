At this stage, dialysis or a kidney transplant might be necessary to sustain life since the kidneys can no longer adequately filter waste from the blood.\n\nTherefore, given these GFR values, especially the most recent one, the primary concern is severe chronic kidney disease with potential progression towards ESRD."
