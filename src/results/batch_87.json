However, given that the highest recorded value is around 7.9 \u00d7 10\u00b3/uL and the lowest is around 4.4 \u00d7 10\u00b3/uL, any value within this range falls within the typical normal reference range of approximately 3.5 to 10.5 \u00d7 10\u00b3/uL for leukocytes in blood. Therefore, on any given encounter date where data was recorded, the patient's leukocyte count appears to be within the normal range."
