Patient summary:
Subject Name and Basic Information:
- Name: Aaron Brekke (Gender: Male)
- Date of Birth: December 10, 1945
- Deceased status confirmed not applicable as the date is March 12, 2012.

Physical Characteristics and Health Metrics:
- Height: The individual stands at a body height of 173.9 cm (Code - Body Height; Value - 173.90 cm).
- Pain Severity Rating: A pain severity score was reported, indicating mild discomfort with a value of 1.16 on the scale from 0 to 10 (Code - Pain severity rating; Value - 1.16).
- Body Weight and BMI: The person weighs 84.17 kg with an associated body mass index (BMI) calculated at 27.83 kg/m², suggesting overweight status (Codes & Values - Code - Body weight; Value - 84.17 kg, Code - BMI; Value - 27.83 kg/m²).
- Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure is recorded at 70.13 mmHg and systolic at 107.09 mmHg (Codes & Values - Component - Diastoliship BP; Value - 70.13, Code - Systole BP; Value - 107.09).
- Glucose Level: Blood sugar level stands at 88.96 mg/dL (Code - Glucose; Value - 88.96 mg/dL), within normal range but requires monitoring considering the BMI value indicating overweight status.
- Urea Nitrogen and Creatinine Levels: Both are at relatively low levels, with urea nitrogen (Code - Urea Nitrogen; Value - 19.92 mg/dL) and creatinine values of 0.87 mg/dL (Codes & Values - Code - Urea Nitrogen; Value - 19.92, Code - Creatinine; Value - 0.87).
- Electrolyte Levels: Calcium levels are at a normal value of 8.98 mg/dL (Code - Calcium; Value - 8.98), and potassium is also within acceptable range with a reading of 4.41 mmol/L (Code - Potassium; Value - 4.41).
- Chloride Level: Atmospheric chloride in the body fluids measures at 107.56 mmol/L, which is within typical limits for a healthy range (Code - Chloride; Value - 107.56) and not indicated to be high or low based on provided data alone (mmolar).
- Carbon Dioxide Level: The carbon dioxide level in the blood measures at 21.76 mmol/L, which is generally considered normal for arterial CO2 levels (Code - Carbon Dioxide; Value - 21.76) indicating adequate respiratory function and acid-base balance.
- Tobacco Smoking Status: The subject has never smoked tobacco products as per NHIS records (Code - Tobacco status, NHIS; Value - Never smoker).
- Hemoglobin A1c/Total Blood HgbA1C Levels: At a value of 6.03%, this indicates slightly elevated but near normal blood sugar control over the past months or years indicating prediabetes (Code - Hemoglobin,total; Value - 6.03%).

Summary Observations: Aaron Brekke was an older male non-smoker with various health measurements recorded on March 12, 2012. He is slightly overweight according to his BMI and has mild pain severity but generally shows normal physiological parameters in blood chemistry tests except for a slight elevation of glucose suggesting the need for monitoring dietary habits or potential prediabetes status due to high body weight, despite never smoking. His other health metrics like electrolyte levels and carbon dioxide concentration are within normal ranges indicating good overall metabolic function at that time.
