Her glucose levels have remained relatively stable around normal ranges (67.72 mg/dL, 88.13 mg/dL, and 89.38 mg/dL), while urea nitrogen has increased from 8.43 mg/dL to 17.07 mg/dL over the same period, which could be indicative of changes in her metabolic status or kidney function.\n\nHer history includes conditions such as chronic kidney disease stages 1 and 2, diabetes-related microalbuminuria, and proteinuria, which are consistent with the observed trends in creatinine and glomerular filtration rate."
